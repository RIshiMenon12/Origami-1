    <p class="div2">This website will teach you how to make origami art.Origami is the art of paper folding, which is
        often
        associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all
        folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
    </p>

    <p class="div2">
        Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes). An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish.
